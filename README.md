Some Python solutions to previous years of the CCC

Hopefully I will complete the last 3 years and then do everything again in C

To test my solutions for 2013, clone the repository by downloading the ZIP file, then navigate to 2013 in the terminal and type in './testing.py' followed by the number of whichever file you want to test. Or just read the source files.
