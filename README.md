Some Python solutions to previous years of the CCC
Hopefully will complete up to 2011 and then do everything over for speed and in C

To test the solutions, clone the repository by downloading the ZIP file, then navigate to a year in the terminal and type in 'python testing.py' followed by the full pathname of whichever file you want to test. Or just read the .py files.
